# Web3 101

## Setting up a web3 website

Cryptocurrency sentiment might be low, and NFTs get a bum rap, but what if I told you NFTs aren't just monkey pictures and web3 is so much more than just blockchains?  

That's what this article is about.  

Web3 is decentralized, peer to peer, and hopefully more open and uncensorable than the increasingly walled gardens of social media and secretive search engines who think it's their job to tell you what you can read and can't read.  

In fact, the tech in this tutorial has just as much to do with the early days of Napster and Torrents as it has to do with Bitcoin.  

Today we'll be looking at how to set up a website breaking with the client-server architecture of old. Hosted on IPFS and accessed through a quirky little smart contract on the Polygon Blockchain.  

And how will we do this? Through GitHub, Next.JS, IPFS, Fleek and Unstoppable Domains that's how!

## Step 1: GitHub
There are lots of ways to get working with web3 and hosting it on IPFS. We could for example write a static index.html by hand and just upload it to [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) or some other pinning service and then link it on Unstoppable Domains, or we could use Unstoppable Domains own website builder, but due to reasons that'll become clearer over time, we want some way of saving, storing backups and easily upload our website. We also want some way of creating larger, more functional websites. And because of the static nature of websites hosted over IPFS, [GitHub](https://www.github.com) will serve as a CMS solution for working with out website.

For this project, I have bought myself a web3 domain by the name of [colorfonts.nft](colorfonts.nft) and so naturally, I'll name the new project Colorfonts.
